To: <redacted>


Dear Mr. Solan and XDA-Developers Management:

 
This letter is sent on behalf of Charter Communications, (“Charter”), owner of numerous rights in connection with the advertising, promotion and sale of its television, Internet, voice and mobile services, including rights associated with its mobile “Spectrum TV” brand service applications and other Charter Proprietary material.

 

It has come to the attention of Charter that XDA Developers/Jb Online Media, LLC (hereinafter, “XDA”) user “Ibuprophen” is using the XDA platform and service to distribute infringing and unlawfully modified versions of Charter’s “Spectrum TV” application (the “App”). Various versions of the infringing, modified app (the “Mod”) began at least as early as September 27, 2018, has been downloaded more than 840 times and continues today. The infringing and unlawful Mod can be found at the following locations within the XDA platform, (which list is not intended to be exhaustive, rather exemplary):

The posting(s) and dissemination of the Mod in any variation infringe Charter’s copyright and/or other intellectual property rights including those exclusive rights to create derivative works guaranteed under the Copyright Act at 17 U.S.C. 106. Charter has a good faith belief that use of the material in the way it is being used has not been authorized. This information is correct. Charter owns the copyright of the App and I, Gary Wengrofsky, am authorized to act on behalf of Charter in this matter. Consequently, in accordance with the rights and protections granted to Charter by various state and federal laws, including and with the prohibition against posting illegal content set forth in the XDA Terms of Service published at https://www.xda-developers.com/xda-tos/, Charter, hereby demands that XDA and JB Online Media immediately remove or disable access to the Material and any and all other confidential and/or trade secret material known or discoverable to XDA. Charter’s official “Spectrum TV” app itself is found in legitimate application stores.

 

Please provide written confirmation by no later than April 12, 2019 that the Mod and all associated versions of the App have been removed. This letter is not a complete statement of Charter’s rights in connection with this matter, and nothing contained herein constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights, remedies, or defenses of Charter in connection with this matter, all of which are expressly reserved.

 

We look forward to your prompt response.
