We have been made aware that your web page http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2367951 displays icons from Icons8.com <http://icons8.com/sendy//l/2kjw/5s/8>. The screenshot of the icons in question is http://take.ms/n00av.

Please accept this letter as official notification that you may be violating the law by infringing on our copyrights. I hereby request that you immediately purchase the license <http://icons8.com/sendy//l/2kjw/6l/8>, as specified in the copyright laws, and ensure the user refrains from using or sharing with others unauthorized materials in the future (see 17 U.S.C. 512).

Legal Use

If you have purchased a license to display our icons legally, please provide us with your order number. If you do not respond by either providing your order number or purchasing a license, we intend to move forward with legal action against you for your copyright infringement.

Unintentional Infringement

Even if your infringement was unintentional or innocent up until now, you now have direct knowledge that you have been using our copyrights without a license. Therefore, not purchasing the license is willful and intentional copyright infringement.

Possible Resolution

Some infringers are willing to remove the icons to reduce the statutory damages, but it is not an acceptable resolution. The only possible resolution is your immediately providing us with your order number. In this case we drop the claim, otherwise we escalate the claim to our attorney.
