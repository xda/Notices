BlackBerry is the owner of numerous trademarks worldwide comprised of, or containing, BLACKBERRY, the BlackBerry Emblem Design, BBM and the BBM Icon (collectively, the BLACKBERRY Trademarks), including in Indonesia, European Union, Canada, United States, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Australia, Benelux, Switzerland, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan.

and the BBM Icon

are the subject of copyright owned by BlackBerry, as is the BBM Application, collectively, the Copyrighted Works

BlackBerry has invested significantly in the development and protection of the BLACKBERRY Trademarks and Copyrighted Works. BlackBerry considers the BLACKBERRY Trademarks and Copyrighted Works to be of material importance to its business and actively takes steps to defend and enforce its rights. As a result of extensive use and publicity, the BLACKBERRY Trademarks have become famous and have attracted considerable reputation and goodwill.

It has come to BlackBerrys attention that the operator of the website located at xda-developers.com has engaged in the wholesale and blatant misappropriation of BlackBerrys intellectual property. The website prominently features the BLACKBERRY Trademarks and Copyrighted Works. We also note that the BBM Icon as it appears on the website has been mutilated or altered without permission.

Further, and very troubling, the website promotes an unauthorized downloadable version of the BBM Application. The BBM Application offered through this website is a mutilated version of the BBM Application and is unauthorized.

Clearly, these activities constitute a flagrant violation of BlackBerrys intellectual property rights and will not, under any circumstances, be tolerated.

Under the circumstances, we respectfully require that your company, as the host, immediately terminate the website located xda-developers.com. Given the substantial unauthorized reproduction BlackBerrys intellectual property together with the highly misleading and deceptive nature of the website and the unauthorized modified version of the BBM Application, it is respectfully submitted that the termination of the website is completely warranted.

We have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law. Further, the information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, and we note that we are authorized to act on behalf of BlackBerry.

We look forward to receipt of your confirmation that the website has been terminated.
